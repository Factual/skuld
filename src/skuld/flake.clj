  "ID generation. Flake IDs are 160 bits, and comprise:

  [64 bits | Timestamp, in milliseconds since the epoch]
  [32 bits | a per-process counter, reset each millisecond]
  [48 bits | a host identifier]
  [16 bits | the process ID]

  Note that the timestamp is not Posix time or UTC time. Instead we use the
  JVM's nanoTime, which is a linear time source over intervals smaller than
  ~292 years, and use it to compute an offset from the POSIX time as measured
  *once* by System/currentTimeMillis.

  Regressions in time are not allowed; Flake will periodically serialize the
  current time to disk to prevent regressions."
