  2. Each leader's claim set is a superset of the previous leader
  
  We have: a target cohort of nodes for the new epoch, provided by helix.
  Some previous cohort of nodes belonging to the old epoch, tracked by ZK.

  To become a leader, one must successfully:

  1. Read the previous epoch+cohort from ZK
  
  2. (optimization) Ensure that the previous epoch is strictly less than the
  epoch this node is going to be the leader for.
  
  3. Broadcast a claim message to the new cohort, union the old cohort

  4. Receive votes from a majority of the nodes in the old cohort

  5. Receive votes from a majority of the nodes in the new cohort

    - At this juncture, neither the new nor the old cohort can commit claims
  for our target epoch or lower, making the set of claims made in older epochs
  immutable. If we are beat by another node using a newer epoch, it will have
  recovered a superset of those claims; we'll fail to CAS in step 8, and no
  claims will be lost.

  6. Obtain all claims from a majority of the old cohort, and union them in to
  our local claim set.

    - This ensures that we are aware of all claims made prior to our epoch.

  7. Broadcast our local claim set to a majority of the new cohort.

    - This ensures that any *future* epoch will correctly recover our claim
      set. 6 + 7 provide a continuous history of claims, by induction.

  8. CAS our new epoch and cohort into zookeeper, ensuring that nobody else
     beat us to it.

  If any stage fails, delay randomly and retry.

  A note on zombies:

  Zombies are nodes which are ready to give up ownership of a vnode but cannot,
  because they may still be required to hand off their claim set. After step 8,
  we inform all zombies which are not a part of our new cohort that it is safe
  to drop their claim set."
