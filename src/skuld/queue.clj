(ns skuld.queue
  "A vnode service which actually provides queuing semantics. You know,
  ordering, priorities, etc.

  Our general strategy with this queue is to be approximately consistent. If
  claim fails, come back and get another task. If a task is missing from this
  queue, AAE will recover it when it does a scan over the DB.

  There's one set of queues per vnode. Each named queue is a rough approximation
  of all tasks that could be claimed on that vnode."
